# Digital / Analog Tandem

The purpose of this course is to explore the possibilities of integrating analog and digital technologies in the field of experimental moving image. Through the use of micro controllers, motors and video equipment, we will dive into hybrid workflows that will enable us to jump back and forth from film to video. The course will revolve around the Crass animation system and its creative potential from a digital mindset and framework of tools.

### Week 4 - Frame by frame

Analog motion graphics. Graphics and text in animation.

Continuation of the overview of the Crass system and explanation about different kinds of film.

Reading material: 

Doug Aitken: Broken Screen: Conversations with Doug Aitken, Expanding the Image Breaking the Narrative. Conversation with Pablo Ferro.

### Week 5 - Analogue practice: Experiments

Hands on immersion in the Crass system. Explanation of formats, 16mm and 35mm. 
Setting up the system in one of the tables. 

Overview of the chemical process and preparation of the developing machine.

Definition of the goals of the experiment and the steps necessary to find the ideal density for the film in combination with the system.

### Week 6 – Continuation of the experiments

Performing the experiment. Explanation of the measuring tools for light and density.

Development of the film, by hand and with the machine. Explanation of analog chemistry and hand development. 

### Week 7 – Analysis of the results and discussion

Analysis of the experiments. Presentation of the final project: based on the results of the experiments the group will develop an animation. Discussion of ideas for group work.

### Week 8 – Electronics and computer fundamentals.

Explanation of fundamental electronic concepts for controlling the animation table. Overview of electronics, software and open source projects. Explanation of the following steps for digitization. Digital moving image and capture methods.

### Week 9 -  Communication protocols, synchronization and video

How to synchronize and bring together analog and digital systems. Broadcasting devices such as the Decklink Ultrastudio in the context of film digitization. Ffmpeg as an open source tool that can bind the computer to the Crass system. Integration of a digital camera in the Crass system. Using the rear projection system for digitization.


### Week 10 – Overview of Computer Numerical Control

CNC in the context of film. How to understand the Crass system in terms of numerical control. Programming effects for the second animation table. Establishing a workflow for quick experimentation and development of results.


### Week 11 – “Analogizing” digital footage

Based on what was learned about communication protocols, micro-controllers and chemical development, we will explore the possibilities of analogizing digital material by integrating a digital projector or a monitor to the system. 

### Week 12 – Improving the workflow

Practical use of the integrated digital source into the system. Tests and development of analogized material.

### Week 13 – Work on the final project

Practical session focused on the development of a final animation.

### Week 14 – Work on the final project

Continuation of the previous week.

### Week 15 – Documentation

Continuation of the work and documentation of the process. All the material produced during the semester will be uploaded online for future reference.
